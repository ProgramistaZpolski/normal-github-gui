# normal-github
A browser extension reverting GitHub's new layout.

```
GitHub rolled out a layout update which people generally do not like.
While there may be already some extensions fixing some of it, here's my take.
The extension is work in progress as of now, but it's stable enough for day-to-day usage.
For now it's available for Chromium-based browsers. Firefox version coming soon (probably when the Chromium version is fully done)
```

## Installation

1. Download.
2. Go to chrome://extensions and click "Load unpacked extensions". A directory select window will pop up.
3. Select the folder where you saved the extension.
4. If you see a new extension called "Normal GitHub", turn it on, refresh GitHub and you're ready to go!

## What does it do
A short answer is already here, but here's a more detailed version:

- Hides the new sidebar
- Changes colors of buttons to match old GitHub
- Takes most important info from the sidebar and puts it on the top (like in old GitHub UI)
- Reduces rounded corners
- Centers the repository header
- Replace some aspects of new GitHub with old ones

You can see everything on screenshots below.
