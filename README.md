# Normal GitHub
A browser extension reverting GitHub's new layout.

GitHub rolled out a layout update which people generally do not like.\
While there may be already some extensions fixing some of it, here's my take.\
The point is to bring the entirety of old GitHub  back.\
The extension is work in progress as of now, but it's stable enough for day-to-day usage.\
Firefox version coming soon.

## Installation

***Chrome extension available [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/normal-github/jefgolcapceamjnpkafdbgjkebjmgflp)!***

Or, if you don't want to use the Web Store...

1. Download.
2. Go to chrome://extensions and click "Load unpacked extensions". A directory select window will pop up.
3. Select the folder where you saved the extension.
4. If you see a new extension called "Normal GitHub", turn it on, refresh GitHub and you're ready to go!

## What does it do
A short answer is already here, but here's a more detailed version:

- Hides the new sidebar
- Changes colors of buttons to match old GitHub
- Restores the top bar
- Reduces rounded corners
- Centers the repository header
- Replace some smaller aspects of new GitHub with old ones

You can see everything on screenshots below.
